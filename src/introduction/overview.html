    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This framework was created to enforce consistency and best practices in the Back40 frontend development process as well as expedite project turn-around. Much of the boilerplate code that we normally deal with has been hidden away, the built-in Javelin modules have been streamlined for development and there are several extra surprises along the way.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><em>A prerequisite knowledge of CSS and LESS is required when using this framework.</em></p>
    <p><strong>LESS is an extension of CSS.</strong> Like other CSS pre-processors, LESS supports a CSS environment that is highly maintainable and conducive to a rapid development process by introducing variables and reusable rulesets.</p>
    <p>When working on a new project, think about what you are building and try to relate your intentions to variables and tools found in the framework to simplify your code and your development process. A consistent and proper usage of these tools can produce very satisfying results!</p>
